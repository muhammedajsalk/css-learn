             <h1>European Holidays For Culture Vultures: A Guide To Summer 2022</h1>

             <p>Europe is home to some of the most renowned artists across the <b>globe</b>, and every piece of artwork, even the very architecture it is housed in, is a testament to the culture and history behind it. Europe is widely known for its historic, yet dynamic and avant-garde art scene, and is constantly changing its approach to the world of art.</p>

             <p>It has been the birthplace of many foundational artistic movements, including the <b>Renaissance </b>(1350-1620), the Impressionist movement(1860-1886) and Cubism (1907-1917) among many others, and the diverse landscape and rich heritage continue to <i>inspire new ideas to this day</i>.</p>

             <p>Here, we’ll look at three of 2022’s top holiday destinations and must-see exhibits for <i><b>creatives, culture vultures, and those who simply fancy an ever-popular European roadtrip.</b></i></p>

             <h2>Paris</h2>

             <p>Paris is home to some of the world's most celebrated art collections, including the Louvre which is widely considered to be the greatest art museum in the world, with 40,000 works on display including the Mona Lisa and <b>9 million</b> visitors every year. The Musée D’Orsay is also an essential visit, with one of the world’s largest collections of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art, including art from famous Parisien artists including Monet, and ranked <i>fifteenth in the most-visited art museums of 2020.</i></p>

             <p>If you’re a lover of French cinema, you must not miss the Cinémathèque Française’s homage to actress Romy Schneider on the 40th anniversary of her death. <i><b>The tribute will feature Schneider’s roles, lines, diary, images, and interviews for a deeper insight into Schneider’s life and creative processes.</b></i> The exhibition will run from March 16th to July 31st 2022.</p>

             <p>The <b>Musée D’Orsay</b>  features a collection of hundreds of works by Edvard Munch, entitled A Poem Of Love, Life And Death from September 20th 2022 to January 22nd 2023. While many people are familiar with The Scream, this exhibition is an eye-opening look into Munch’s artistic career and reveals a depth and diversity to his works which often escapes the public eye.</p></p>
